# Vendor Analysis: Baseten

## Overview
Baseten provides serverless GPU infrastructure optimized for model serving and inference, allowing for auto-scaling and managed deployments.

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2019.
- **Employees:** ~60 - 100.
- **Revenue:** Reported 10x growth in 2025 (estimated multi-million ARR).
- **Funding:** Significant venture backing.
- **Incidents:** 
    - **Fires:** No reports of physical fires.
    - **Outages:** Experienced degraded performance and scale-up issues in late 2025, though dedicated inference was largely stable.

## Economic Risk Analysis
Baseten is in a high-growth startup phase. The primary risk is market consolidation or a shift in venture capital sentiment. Operationally, its serverless model introduces abstraction layers that can fail independently of the underlying hardware providers.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.42** (Moderate)
*Confidence Interval: [0.35, 0.49]*
Risk is moderated by strong growth but elevated due to startup-scale and dependency on upstream cloud providers.
