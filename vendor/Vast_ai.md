## Overview
The largest decentralized P2P GPU marketplace. Users rent directly from individual hosts (often miners or small data centers).

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2018.
- **Employees:** ~38.
- **Security:** Achieved SOC 2 Type I in 2025.
- **Risk:** Inherently high due to the P2P model. A host's house/facility could burn down, taking your data with it.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.62** (High)
*Confidence Interval: [0.55, 0.69]*
Technically excellent platform, but economic and physical risk is highly distributed and variable.
