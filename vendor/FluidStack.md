# Vendor Analysis: FluidStack

## Overview
An "AI Factory" provider that secures massive-scale GPU deployments, often in partnership with governments or large crypto-miners.

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2017.
- **Revenue:** Estimated $180M ARR (2024).
- **Scale:** Secured $11B deal with the French government; $50B partnership with Anthropic.
- **Employees:** ~20 - 100 (Varied estimates).

## Economic Risk Analysis
FluidStack operates on a "Broker/Manager" model at an extreme scale. The primary risk is the complexity of these multi-billion dollar contracts and the reliance on third-party "AI Factories" for physical infrastructure.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.34** (Moderate-Low)
*Confidence Interval: [0.28, 0.40]*
Huge contracted revenue lowers risk, but the specialized nature and large deal dependencies add uncertainty.
