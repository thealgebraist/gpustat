# Vendor Analysis: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

## Overview
AWS is the global leader in cloud infrastructure, operating as a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. It provides the largest array of services and maintains the most significant market share.

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2006 (First service SQS in 2004).
- **Employees:** ~143,000 (as of 2025).
- **Revenue:** $107.6 Billion (2024).
- **Stock:** Subsidiary of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Stock has shown strong long-term growth with high volatility during AI-driven cycles.
- **Incidents:** 
    - **Fires:** Minor fire at a construction site in 2025 (Indiana). No major fleet-wide fire losses.
    - **Outages:** Notable global DNS/DynamoDB outage in Oct 2025 (15+ hours). Historically high-impact outages in US-EAST-1.

## Economic Risk Analysis
The primary risk for AWS is its sheer scale and the concentration of services in specific regions (US-EAST-1). While financially extremely stable, a regulatory "breakup" of Amazon or a global management plane failure (as seen in 2025) remains the primary threat.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.15** (Very Low)
*Confidence Interval: [0.10, 0.20]*
The score is low due to massive revenue and corporate backing, slightly offset by the "too big to fail" complexity and recent global DNS issues.
