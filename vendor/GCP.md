## Economic Risk Analysis
GCP is now profitable after years of investment. The main risk is Google's history of "killing" products, although this is unlikely for the core Cloud division. It remains highly susceptible to Alphabet's advertising-driven stock volatility.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.18** (Low)
*Confidence Interval: [0.14, 0.22]*
Slightly higher risk than AWS/Azure due to lower market share and more recent profitability.
