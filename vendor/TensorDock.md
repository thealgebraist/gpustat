# Vendor Analysis: TensorDock

## Overview
A GPU marketplace that aggregates capacity from Tier 3 and Tier 4 data centers globally.

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2021.
- **Acquired:** By Voltage Park in March 2025.
- **Employees:** ~30.
- **Incidents:** No major infrastructure-wide fires. marketplace model means quality varies by host.

## Economic Risk Analysis
Acquisition by Voltage Park (a large-scale AI infra project) provides significant stability. However, the marketplace nature means "Hidden Risks" reside with the individual hosts, not just TensorDock itself.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.38** (Moderate)
*Confidence Interval: [0.32, 0.44]*
Risk decreased following the 2025 acquisition, but remains moderate due to the decentralized host model.
