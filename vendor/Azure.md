# Vendor Analysis: Microsoft Azure

## Overview
Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform, deeply integrated into the enterprise ecosystem. It has seen the fastest growth in the AI sector (2024-2025).

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2010 (Launched as Windows Azure).
- **Employees:** ~20,000 (Directly in Azure), 227,000 (Microsoft Total).
- **Revenue:** ~$75 Billion (FY 2025).
- **Stock:** Subsidiary of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Currently one of the world's most valuable companies.
- **Incidents:**
    - **Fires:** No major fire losses. September 2017 outage was caused by a fire-suppression gas discharge (no actual fire).
    - **Outages:** Major 8-hour global DNS/Front Door disruption in Oct 2025. Historical Azure AD (Identity) failures.

## Economic Risk Analysis
Economic risk is extremely low due to diverse revenue streams (Windows, Office, Gaming). The primary operational risk is the **Global Identity (Entra ID)** single point of failure, which can paralyze the entire cloud regardless of region.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.12** (Very Low)
*Confidence Interval: [0.08, 0.16]*
Lower risk than AWS due to more diversified corporate revenue, though slightly higher identity-layer vulnerability.
