# Vendor Analysis: CoreWeave

## Overview
CoreWeave is a specialized GPU cloud provider that pivoted from crypto mining to AI infrastructure. It is known for being among the first to offer high-end NVIDIA hardware.

## Economic & Operational Profile
- **Founded:** 2017 (as Atlantic Crypto).
- **Employees:** ~1,450 (as of 2025).
- **Revenue:** ~$1.9 Billion (2024), projecting over $5 Billion in 2025.
- **Funding:** Heavy debt and equity financing (collateralized by H100 GPUs).
- **Incidents:**
    - **Fires:** CEOs reported a "near-fire" event in 2017 due to GPU heat in Manhattan, leading to a relocation to NJ.
    - **Operational:** Triggered technical defaults on loans in 2024 related to fund transfer terms.

## Economic Risk Analysis
CoreWeave is "leveraged to the hilt" on GPU demand. Their debt is secured by the very hardware they rent out. A sudden drop in AI inference demand or a hardware-specific flaw in NVIDIA chips would be an existential threat.

## Gaussian Risk Variable
**$\sigma_{risk}$ = 0.32** (Moderate-Low)
*Confidence Interval: [0.26, 0.38]*
Massive revenue and Tier-1 status with NVIDIA lower the risk, but the heavy debt-to-GPU leverage keeps it above the Big Three.
